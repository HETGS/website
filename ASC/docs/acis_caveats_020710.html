This document describes potential problems or concerns about ACIS event data 
processed using the standard pipeline.  The issues are categorized according 
to the nature of the caveat.
</P>

<P>
TIME:
</P>

<OL>

<LI>
<P>
The values recorded in the column TIME of the ACIS event data files for 
     continuous-clocking mode observations are associated with the times the 
     events are read out, not the times of arrival of the events.  As a 
     result, searches for pulsed signals may yield inaccurate results unless 
     the effects of the motion of the telescope (dither) and the SIM are is 
     removed from the event TIMEs.  The results of absolute timing or 
     absolute phase analyses will be inaccurate unless the length of time 
     required to read out an event is subtracted from the TIME of the event.  
     The tool acis_process_events will be modified to compute the times of 
     arrival of events.  For the time being, users should contact the 
     helpdesk for specific instructions about how to compute the times of 
     arrival of events.
</P>

<LI>
<P> 
The values in the column TIME of the continuous-clocking Level 0 event
     files were computed incorrectly before October 5, 1999.  The 
     contribution to the time associated with the value of TROW was double 
     counted.  This problem was propagated to the Level 1 and Level 2 event
     files.  The problem was corrected as of October 5, 1999.  The earlier 
     data sets are being reprocessed.
</P>

<LI> 
<P>
The values of TIME associated with data collected using very-long 
     exposures (e.g. the RAW, HISTO, and GRADED_HISTO DATAMODEs) are not 
     reliable because the counter associated with the front-end processor 
     rolls over every 328 s and this roll over affects the time assigned to 
     the events.  These data sets are generally analyzed by only the 
     instrument scientists.

An algorithm is being developed to compensate for some of the effects of the 
    loss of charge due to charge-transfer inefficiency (CTI).  Analyses 
    show that the algorithm can significantly improve the energy resolution 
    of the front-side illuminated CCDs, especially for events that occur far 
    from the read out (i.e. at large CHIPY values).  The algorithm is being 
    implemented in acis_process_events.
</P>

<LI>
<P>
Users who are analyzing ACIS data from continuous-clocking mode observations
    should be aware that the method used to compute the values of the bias
    map for continuous-clocking mode fails if a cosmic ray deposits a lot of
    charge along most of a column of a CCD.  In this case, the bias values
    will be systematically overestimated and the values of PHA, ENERGY, and
    PI will be systematically underestimated for the pixels in this column.
    Since the tools used to generate ARFs and exposure maps do not
    compensate for this problem, a user may wish to exclude events that
    occur in the affected columns from their analyses and compute ARFs and
    exposure maps appropriately.  The problem applies to the data for all
    existing continuous-clocking mode observations.  Alternative techniques
    of computing the bias that are not affected by this problem are being
    studied.  However, until such a technique is implemented, all new
    continuous-clocking mode observations will also be affected.  Only the
    front-side illuminated CCDs are sensitive to this problem.  The
    back-side illuminated CCDs are not.  It is possible for a fairly large
    fraction of the columns of a front-side illuminated CCD to be adversely
    affected.  This problem is unique to continuous-clocking mode
    observations.  It does not affect the bias maps of timed exposure mode
    observations.  If a user is concerned that the spectral data for the
    source they are studying is adversely affected by a bad bias, please
    contact the Chandra helpdesk.  
</P>

<LI>
<P>
The energy-scale of the ACIS CCDs is calibrated only over the range 
     0.277-9.886 keV.  Users should be cautious about analyzing data outside 
     this range.
</P>

<LI>
<P>
The files used to determine the gain and spectral response of the ACIS CCDs 
     have changed several times over the life of the Chandra mission.  These 
     changes reflect reductions in the temperature of the focal plane, 
     increases in the charge-transfer inefficiency, and improvements in the 
     understanding of the performance of the detectors.  Users interested in 
     the PIs or ENERGYs of events should verify that their data were 
     processed using the latest gain file appropriate for the focal-plane 
     temperature of their observation.  If necessary, an ACIS event data 
     file can be reprocessed using acis_process_events to update these 
     columns.  Users analyzing PI spectra should ensure that the FEF file 
     used to produce a PI response-matrix file (RMF) for their data matches 
     the gain file used to process the data.  This condition should be 
     satisfied if the latest appropriate versions of the FEF and gain files 
     are used.  If users are concerned about a possible mismatch, they 
     should contact the helpdesk.
</P>

<LI>
<P>
The values in the columns ENERGY and PI in ACIS event data files are 
     quantized.  The difference between one energy and the next is about 4 eV.  
     (The exact value is energy dependent and varies from region to region 
     on a CCD).  The difference between one PI and the next is (by default) 
     always 14.6 eV.  Since the value of the PI of an event is a quantized 
     representation of the value of the ENERGY of the event and since the 
     width of a PI bin is not an integer multiple of the difference between 
     neighboring values of ENERGY, PI spectra for bright sources may exhibit 
     periodic spikes.  For example, some PI bins may contain 3 energy points 
     and some may contain four.  PHA spectra do not suffer from this problem.  
     The algorithm used to compute the value of the ENERGY of an event has 
     been modified to include a small random component uniformly distributed 
     between -0.5 and +0.5 adu (i.e. about -2 eV and +2 eV).  Observations 
     performed after July 2, 2001 do not suffer from this problem.  The 
     older data is being reprocessed, but until it has been, it is possible 
     for users to rerun acis_process_events to remove the problem in the 
     older data. 
</P>

<LI>
<P>
The meaningful values of the column PI in an ACIS event data file are n <= 
     PI <= 1023, where n is approximately 6 for the two back-side-illuminated
     CCDs (ACIS-S1 and ACIS-S3) and approximately 10 for the eight
     front-side-illuminated CCDs.  (The exact value of the lower limit 
     varies from region to region on a CCD.)  PI = 1024 is an overflow bin.  
     PI = 0 corresponds to the special case where PHA <= 0.  This value 
     should not occur normally.  
</P>

<LI>
<P>
The values in the PHA, ENERGY, PI, GRADE, and FLTGRADE columns of ACIS event 
     data files may not be meaningful if the observed source is a bright 
     optical source (e.g. Jupiter).  Users should contact the helpdesk for 
     assistance with the analysis of the ACIS data for such observations.
</P>
</OL>

<P>
EVENT FILTERING:
</P>

<P>
Users analyzing ACIS event data should ensure that the data have been 
     filtered to exclude events that may not be "good" X-ray events.  The 
     data filtering may include the STATUS or GRADE of an event, events 
     occurring during time intervals where the cosmic-ray background rate is 
     substantially larger than the nominal rate, events associated with a 
     cosmic-ray "afterglow", events occurring on flaring pixels, events 
     found in horizontal "streaks", and so forth.
</P>

<OL>
<LI>
<P>
The column STATUS in ACIS event data files contains a 
     <a href="docs.html#evtbits">bit-encoded</a> 
     description of possible problems that may be associated with an event.  
     One or more of the bits in the STATUS column is set to one if an event 
     is suspicious.  While all telemetered events are included in ACIS "evt1" 
     data files, only those with no STATUS bits set to one are included in 
     ACIS "evt2" data files.  
</P>

<LI>
<P>
The column GRADE (and FLTGRADE) in ACIS event data files contains a numeric 
     description of the distribution of charge in a 3 pixel x 3 pixel event 
     detection region.  Some GRADEs are dominated by events associated with 
     cosmic rays instead of X rays.  These GRADEs should be excluded from 
     event data analyses.  Since the ACIS detectors are calibrated using 
     data that have GRADE = 0, 2, 3, 4, or 6, events with GRADE = 0, 2, 3, 4, 
     or 6 should, in general, be included when performing analyses of the 
     data and events with GRADE = 1, 5, or 7 should be excluded.  Interested 
     users should refer to the Proposers' Observatory Guide for additional 
     information about GRADE and FLTGRADE.
</P>

<LI>
<P>
At times, the Chandra satellite passes through regions of relatively 
     high particle fluxes.  These occasions may be associated with 
     "<a href="http://asc.harvard.edu/cal/Links/Acis/acis/Cal_prods/bkgrnd/10_20/bg201000.html">flares</a>"
     in the ACIS background rate.  Users may want to exclude the data 
     obtained during the time intervals associated with these flares.  The 
     flares can be identified by examining light curves of source-free 
     regions of the back-side illuminated CCDs ACIS-S1 and ACIS-S3. 
</P>

<LI>
<P>
An "afterglow" is produced on a front-side illuminated CCD when a cosmic ray 
     deposits a large amount of charge on a CCD and some of the charge is 
     removed relatively slowly.  As a result, events are reported for the 
     same pixel in two or more consecutive frames.  In general, the PHA 
     values of these events steadily decrease from one frame to the next and 
     the values of the FLTGRADE (and GRADE) of the events remain the same.  
     This problem can produce false sources or confuse the spatial or 
     spectral analyses of real sources.  The tool acis_detect_afterglow can 
     be used to identify events that may be associated with afterglows and 
     to set appropriate STATUS bits to one for these events.  The tool is 
     part of the standard pipeline processing and the CIAO data-analysis 
     suite.  Be aware that acis_detect_afterglow may have the undesired 
     effect of identifying real X-ray events as afterglows, especially for 
     bright X-ray sources.  (See this 
     <a href="https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/ciao/why/afterglow.html">
     link</a> for more information.)
</P>

<P>
Horizontal streaks (i.e. streaks at a constant value of CHIPY) are observed 
     on the ACIS-S4 CCD.  A streak is the occurrence of several events that 
     have the same value of CHIPY on the same CCD in the same frame of data.  
     Streak events are spatially correlated with the read-out nodes and have 
     small pulse-height amplitudes.  These streaks are produced by read-out 
     noise.  The tool destreak can be used to identify potential streak 
     events and set a STATUS bit for them.  The horizontal streaks should 
     not to be confused with the vertical "frame-transfer" streaks that are 
     evident for bright sources.  The vertical streaks are produced when 
     events from a source are detected as the accumulated charge in a frame 
     is being transfered row-by-row into the image-store region for read out.
</P>

<LI>
<P>
For observations that are performed using TIMED VFAINT mode, the outer 16 
     pixels of a 5 pixel x 5 pixel event "island" may be used to help reject 
     potential cosmic ray events.  An algorithm to perform this kind of 
     event filtering has been incorporated into the tool acis_process_events.  
     Interested users should use ahelp to obtain more information about 
     parameters associated with this algorithm: check_vf_pha and trail.  
     Users should be very cautious about using a value other than the 
     default value for the parameter trail.  Be aware that the algorithm can 
     reject up to several tens of percent of good X-ray events for bright 
     sources.
</P>

<LI>
<P>
A relatively large number of events are reported for the node boundaries at 
     CHIPX = 256, 257, 512, 513, 768, and 769.  Most of the events are 
     associated with cosmic-ray events that would not normally have been 
     telemetered if the event islands had not been split across the node 
     boundary.  Events in these columns should, in general, be excluded from 
     data used for analyses and are now excluded by default from ACIS "evt2" 
     data files.

During the time interval from August 14, 1999 to September 17, 1999 the ACIS 
     CCDs experienced episodes of relatively large doses of ionizing 
     radiation.  As a result, the efficiency with which charge is 
     transferred from pixel to pixel during the read out process is 
     diminished, especially for the front-side illuminated CCDs.  The 
     increased charge-transfer inefficiency (CTI) means that (1) the total 
     amount of charge associated with an X-ray of a given energy is larger 
     near the read out (i.e. at low values of CHIPY) than far from it, (2) 
     the energy resolution and quantum efficiency are better near the read 
     out, and (3) the distribution of event GRADEs varies as a function of 
     position on a CCD.  Since the energy scale and energy resolution are 
     functions of the position of the source on a CCD, analyses of spectra 
     from different regions of a CCD should use RMFs that are appropriate 
     for each region.
</P>

<LI>
<P>
If more than one X-ray photon interacts in the same event-detection region of
     a CCD (a 3 pixel x 3 pixel "island") during the same frame, the charge 
     clouds produced by these photon events are said to be "piled."  The 
     event-processing software can not distinguish between an event produced 
     by one photon and an event produced by more than one photon.  Therefore, 
     the X-ray spectrum of a source that is significantly piled may not 
     resemble the spectrum of the photons that are incident on the detector. A 
     <a href="http://space.mit.edu/~davis/papers/pileup2001.ps">technique</a>
     has been developed to analyze piled spectra.  Pileup models are 
     available in the spectral-fitting packages 
     <a href="http://space.mit.edu/ASC/ISIS/">ISIS</a>,
     <a href="https://cxc.cfa.harvard.edu/sherpa/">Sherpa</a>, and
     <a href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xanadu/xspec/manual/manual.html">XSPEC</a>.  
     If pileup is severe, piled events may be lost because the events do not 
     satisfy the telemetry criteria or the events have GRADE = 1, 5, or 7.  
     For example, Chandra images of the Crab pulsar and nebula exhibit a 
     "hole" where the pulsar is located because the X-ray flux is large 
     enough that many X-ray events are detected in a single frame.  The 
     resulting, single, piled event does not satisfy the telemetry criteria 
     because it saturates the analog to digital converters or the FLTGRADE 
     of the event is one of the few FLTGRADEs that is dominated by cosmic-ray 
     events and not telemetered to the ground.
</P>

<LI>
<P>
Cosmic rays that interact in the detectors can produce particle cascades 
     that deposit charge in many adjacent pixels.  Typically, it is not 
     possible to detect a good X-ray event if the event interacts in one of 
     the affected pixels.  Therefore, these charge cascades (or "blooms") 
     reduce the detection efficiency of the detectors.  A preliminary 
     analysis indicates that the detection efficiency is reduced by roughly 
     5% for the front-side illuminated CCDs and is not significantly 
     affected for the back-side illuminated CCDs.  For these reasons, the 
     fluxes of X-ray sources observed using a front-side illuminated CCD are 
     underestimated by roughly 5%.  The cosmic-ray flux that produces the 
     blooms varies in time and the spatial distribution of the blooms 
     adversely affect some regions of a CCD more than others.  The effects 
     of the blooms are being investigated.
</P>

<LI>
<P>
The count rates of parts of two CCDs are relatively low.  These regions 
     are NODE_ID = 3 of CCD_ID = 2 (ACIS-I2) and NODE_ID = 1 of CCD_ID = 6 
     (ACIS-S2).  These two nodes are functioning properly.  Fewer events are 
     telemetered for these two nodes because they have relatively small
     overclock values.  As a result, fewer of the events that saturate the 
     analog-to-digital converters are telemetered.  Since these events are 
     generally background events, this feature should not impair the 
     scientific utility of the two nodes.
</P>

<LI>
<P>
The front-end processor designated FEP0 had a problem.  Half of the bias-map 
     memory for the processor was corrupted.  This problem resulted in 
     the loss of some useful X-ray data and the telemetry of many invalid 
     events.  To the best of our knowledge, this problem has only affected 
     twelve observations.  The effects of the problem should be visually 
     obvious in images of the data: half of the CCD associated with FEP0 has 
     many events and appears bright in the image.  A patch to the flight 
     software has been prepared to avoid this problem.  This patch became 
     active in February 2000.  Now, after ten bias parity errors have 
     occurred during a science run (an extremely rare event under normal 
     conditions), the patch causes the affected half of the CCD to be 
     disabled until a new bias-map is placed in memory.  Since the patch was 
     implemented, the problem has not recurred.
